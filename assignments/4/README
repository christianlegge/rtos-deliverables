Compile server.c and client.c with -pthread:

$ gcc -pthread server.c -o server
$ gcc -pthread client.c -o client

Neither program takes command line arguments.

Start server and wait for the "Waiting for connection from client" message. Then run client.
Client will ask for a username and, once a valid (alphanumeric + underscores) one is provided,
attempt to connect to the server. If this is achieved, the client will join the #general room.

Once connected, type and press Enter to send messages to the room. There are a few commands that can be run:

- /hello: send the hello RPC
- /create <room>: creates a room 
- /list: lists available rooms
- /join <room>: joins a room (must be created first)
- /users: lists users in current room 

To send a message that begins with a slash, type two slashes (For example, to answer the question
"What do I type to list users?" type "//list" and send).
