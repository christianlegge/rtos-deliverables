        a. The "man x" command provides you a manual for the command x, an explanation of how to use the command x

        b. Section 2 is system calls, which allows the command to interact with the linux kernel. System calls are generally not invoked directly, but have a c library wrapper function to perform the system call
        Section 3 is library functions, the wrapper used in section 2 to perform the system call.
        
        c. write(x) writes up to x bytes from the buffer pointed buf to the file referred to by the file descriptor fd.
        so write(1) will write up to 1 byte from the buffer, whereas write(2) writes up to 2 bytes from the buffer.
