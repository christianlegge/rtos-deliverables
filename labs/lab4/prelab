NETWORK BYTE ORDER
1.
	when a multi-octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first
2.
	53	00 35	35 00
	67	00 43	43 00
	68	00 44	44 00
	80	00 50	50 00
	8080	1F 90	90 1F

NETWORK PROTOCOL
1.
	 ciaddr  4       client IP address;
                         filled in by client in bootrequest if known.

         yiaddr  4       'your' (client) IP address;
                         filled by server if client doesn't
                         know its own address (ciaddr was 0).
2.
	This means that the pc wasnt able to find a routable address available
3.
	header 		16*6	 12 Bytes
	question	16*3	 6 Bytes
			  	 18 Bytes
4.
	Ports from 0-1023 are reserved for privileged users.

PACKET CAPTURE
1.
	-n makes the command not convert addresses to names
2.
	-w makes the command write the packets to a file instead of the screen
3.	
	-i ant captures packets from all interfaces. This precludes capturing in promiscuous mode. 		Promiscuous mode manipulates the hardware interface directly to accept any and all messages.
