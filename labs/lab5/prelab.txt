Altera SoC boot overview

1. An HPS is a hard processor system.
2. HPS boot process:
	Reset (CPU exits from reset, e.g. powers on)
	Boot ROM (Selects boot source, sets up clock manager)
	Preloader (User defined, generally initializes SDRAM - without this, boot software may not fit on available 60kB on-chip RAM)
	Boot Loader (User defined, loads OS, passes software control to OS)
3. A warm boot is a boot loaded from the on-chip RAM, and a cold boot is a boot loaded from another source (FPGA or flash memory).
4. Preloader offset 0x40 must contain a validation word (0x31305341).
5. Preloader images can be up to 60 kB in size due to the 64 kB size of the on-chip RAM with 4 kB reserved for boot ROM data and the stack.
6. The boot ROM reads the preloader image header to find the entry point address, which it jumps to to start running the preloader image.

Disk partitions

1. FAT12 - 0x01
	FAT16 - 0x04
	FAT16B - 0x06
	exFAT - 0x07
	Logical sectored FAT12/FAT16 (Commodore) - 0x08
	FAT32 (CHS) - 0x0B
	FAT32 (LBA) - 0x0C
	FAT16B (LBA) - 0x0E
	Logical sectored FAT12/FAT16 (Leading Edge) - 0x11
	Hidden FAT12 (IBM) - 0x11
	Bootable FAT - 0x12
	Logical sectored FAT12/FAT16 (AST) - 0x14
	Hidden FAT16 (IBM) - 0x14
	Hidden FAT16B (IBM) - 0x16
	Hidden exFAT (IBM) - 0x17
	Hidden FAT32 (IBM) - 0x1B
	Hidden FAT32 (LBA) (IBM) - 0x1C
	
2. CHS = cylinder-head-sector; coordinates correspond to physical locations on a hard disk. Used because early hard drives did not have an embedded disk controller so the OS could not abstract addresses to a linear list of 0 to (blocks - 1). Came before LBA.
	LBA = logical block addressing; linear list of blocks. Actual physical locations of data resolved by disk hardware. Used more often today because it is simpler and allows better adaptability (all hard drives compatible).
	
3. Modern Linux filesystems use the ext4 filesystem. The partition ID is 0x83 (131 in decimal).

4. FreeBSD slices use the BSD slice filesystem. The partition ID is 0xA5 (165 in decimal).

5. Partition id 0xA2 is used for the Altera Cyclone V HPS ARM preloader.

Disk and file inspection tools

1. 
	1. dd(1) copies one file to another, with several conversion options built in.
	2. dd bs=512 count=64 if=srcfile of=dstfile
2.
	1. The string ".ELF" (0x00), the string "Congratulations on completing ENGI %d!" (0x50), "GCC: (crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1-4.8-2014.04 - Linaro GCC 4.8-2014.04)" (0x79) Possibly the GCC version that compiled it?
	2. 
		1. 8894.o conforms to the current ELF version as the bytes of the e_version entry are 01 00 00 00 for 1.
		2. This is a 32-bit object file as the word size is 32 bits.
		3. This is compiled for a little-endian machine as the numerical values in the header are stored with little-endianness.
		4. This is a relocatable object file as shown by the e_type value at 0x10, 01 00 = 1 for relocatable.
	3. The "Congratulations" string seems to have the format of a printf call, so this probably prints "Congratulations on completing ENGI xxxx" where xxxx is a course number, possibly taken from user input.
3.
	1. objdump -s displays the full contents of the requested sections, by default displaying the contents of all non-empty sections.
	2. objdump -d displays the asembler mnemonics for the machine instructions in the object file. Only disassembles sections which should contain instructions.
	3. The value 8894 (hex 0x22be) is stored in r3 as seen in offset 0x28.
